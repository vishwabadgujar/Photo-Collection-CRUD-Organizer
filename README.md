The Photo Collection CRUD Organizer project is a foundational Python command-line application designed to manage the textual metadata associated with a photo collection. It systematically utilizes the four fundamental database operations—**Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD)**—to handle digital index entries rather than the actual image files themselves. The program stores the photo details, such as a unique **ID**, **Title**, **Date Taken**, **Location**, and a set of searchable **Tags**, within a Python list of dictionaries. To ensure data permanence, the application employs the **`json`** module for **persistence**, automatically saving the entire collection to a file (like `my_photos_data.json`) upon exit and reloading it at startup. The interface allows users to easily add new photo entries (Create), view the entire collection or search for specific photos by tag or title (Read), modify existing information (Update) when details change, and permanently remove outdated entries (Delete), providing a complete system for cataloging and managing the descriptive information of a large personal photo archive.
